<h1>Encyclopediea Iranica entry on Tepe Yahya</h1>
<p>An archeological site in the Soḡun valley (lat 28°20′N, long 56°52′E), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerman"> <i>Kerman</i></a> province, ca. 220 km south of <i>Kerman</i> and 130 km north of the Straits of Hormuz. The site is a mound (tepe), 19.8 m. high, 187 m. in diameter at the base, and was discovered in 1967 by a survey team from Harvard University under the direction of C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky (Lamberg-Karlovsky, 1970, pp. 1-5; Negahban). <a href="http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tepe-yahya"> <b>Tepe Yahya</b></a> was occupied, with interruptions, from the late Neolithic (ca. 5500 BCE) to the early Sasanian (300 CE) period. To date, the 6th through 3rd millennium BCE levels have been fully published, whereas those dating to the later periods are still under study. Thus, the sequence of occupation that follows (after Thornton et al., pp. 1452-3; Potts, 2001, pp. 195-207; Beale, 1986, p. 11) remains tentative, particularly for periods IVA through I.</p>

<p>Following an initial sounding in 1967, six full seasons of excavations were conducted at Tepe Yahya (1968-71, 1973, 1975) and the site continues to provide the only long stratigraphic sequence in all of southeastern Persia.</p>

<p>Period VII is represented by four sub-phases (D-A). The best-preserved architecture dates to VIIB and VIIA and consists of multi-room dwellings and storage rooms of a cell-like nature, often covering an area less than 2 square meters. These are built of molded, thumb-impressed mud bricks, generally measuring 36 x 15/16 x 9/10 cm (Beale, 1986, p. 111). Generally similar dwellings appear in periods VI and V (particularly VC). Periods VIB and VIA are also characterized by several noteworthy features, including areas of paving, a retaining wall, and large quantities of stone-and-shard rubble fill. Small quantities of exotic foreign materials, including Anatolian obsidian, turquoise, lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl, appear in the early levels at Tepe Yahya (Beale, 1973), as does a single shard of Mesopotamian ʿObayd-type pottery (Kamilli and Lamberg-Karlovsky, pp. 53-54), suggesting long-distance contacts in the 6th and 5th millennia BCE. The faunal assemblage during the early periods is dominated by domesticated sheep, goat, and cattle remains (Meadow, 1986, Fig. 3.3).</p>
