<h1>Constantine the Great</h1>

<div>

<p><a class="one" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great"> <img src="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/lostgospel/_images/_timeline/10_01.jpg" alt="Constantine" width="120" height="120"> </a>
The age of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great">Constantine</a> marked a distinct epoch in the history of the <span class="place">Roman Empire</span>. He built a new imperial residence at <span class="place">Byzantium</span> and renamed the city <span class="place">Constantinople</span> after himself (the laudatory epithet of "New Rome" came later, and was never an official title). It would later become the capital of the Empire for over one thousand years; for which reason the later <span class="place">Eastern Empire</span> would come to be known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. His more immediate political legacy was that, in leaving the empire to his sons, he replaced <span class="people">Diocletian's</span> tetrarchy with the principle of dynastic succession. His reputation flourished during the lifetime of his children and centuries after his reign. The medieval church upheld him as a paragon of virtue while secular rulers invoked him as a prototype, a point of reference, and the symbol of imperial legitimacy and identity. Beginning with the Renaissance, there were more critical appraisals of his reign due to the rediscovery of anti-Constantinian sources. Critics portrayed him as a tyrant. Trends in modern and recent scholarship attempted to balance the extremes of previous scholarship.</p>

<p><a class="one" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactantius"> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Lactantius.jpg" alt="Lactantius" width="150" height="120"></a>
<span class="people">Lactantius'</span> <i>De Mortibus Persecutorum</i>, a political Christian pamphlet on the reigns of <span class="people">Diocletian</span> and the Tetrarchy, provides valuable but tendentious detail on <span class="people">Constantine's</span> predecessors and early life. The ecclesiastical histories of <span class="people">Socrates</span>, <span class="people">Sozomen</span>, and <span class="people">Theodoret</span> describe the ecclesiastic disputes of <span class="people">Constantine's</span> later reign. Written during the reign of <span class="people">Theodosius II</span> (from 408 to 50 AD), a century after <span class="people">Constantine's</span> reign, these ecclesiastic historians obscure the events and theologies of the Constantinian period through misdirection, misrepresentation and deliberate obscurity. The contemporary writings of the orthodox Christian <span class="people">Athanasius</span> and the ecclesiastical history of the Arian <span class="people">Philostorgius</span> also survive, though their biases are no less firm. </p>

<span class="people">Flavius Valerius Constantinus</span>, as he was originally named, was born in the city of <span class="place">Naissus</span>, (today <span class="place">Nis</span>, <span class="place">Serbia</span>) part of the <span class="place">Dardania</span> province of <span class="place">Moesia</span> on 27 February, probably c. 272 AD. His father was <span class="people">Flavius Constantius</span>, an Illyrian, and a native of <span class="place">Dardania</span> province of <span class="place">Moesia</span> (later <span class="place">Dacia Ripensis</span>).<span class="people">Constantine</span> probably spent little time with his father who was an officer in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Roman_army">Roman army</a>, part of the Emperor <span class="people">Aurelian's</span> imperial bodyguard. Being described as a tolerant and politically skilled man, <span class="people">Constantius</span> advanced through the ranks, earning the governorship of <span class="place">Dalmatia</span> from Emperor <span class="people">Diocletian</span>, another of <span class="people">Aurelian's</span> companions from <span class="place">Illyricum</span>, in 284 or 285. <span class="people">Constantine's</span> mother was <span class="people">Helena</span>, possibly a Bithynian woman of low social standing. It is uncertain whether she was legally married to <span class="people">Constantius</span> or merely his concubine. It is unclear if <span class="people">Constantine</span> could speak Thracian, his main language being Latin, during his public speeches he needed Greek translators. </p>
