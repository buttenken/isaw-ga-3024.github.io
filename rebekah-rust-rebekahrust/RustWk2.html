<h1>A Study in the Relationship between Text and Performance</h1>

<h2>Fiona Macintosh, "Conquering England: Ireland and Greek Tragedy" in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pTzhCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA329&lpg=PA329&dq=yeats+oedipus+rex+scream&source=bl&ots=LpHx_lLD9B&sig=_zLZFiB--iTFJvqViTjBWWsAWsM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwisqOj00orPAhVGOyYKHefzDhQQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q=yeats%20oedipus%20rex%20scream&f=false"><i>A Handbook to the Reception of Greek Drama</i>, p. 329</a></h2>
(<i>N.B.</i> Terms relating to the performance are in <b>bold</b> and those related to the text are in <i>italics</i>.)<br><br>
"In many ways, it was <span class="text">Yeats’ text</span> that made possible <span class="performance">Olivier’s consummate performance</span> as the lonely hero pushed beyond normal human endurance. When Olivier discovered the truth about himself, he <span class="performance">emitted,</span> his (now famous) <span class="performance">primal scream</span> (in direct imitation, we are told of the <span class="performance">wailing of ermine</span> entrapped by the barbarous practices of huntsmen) (Olivier 1982:154). This <span class="performance">“scream”</span> has entered into the annals of British theater history and it is <span class="text">Yeats’ text</span> that permits it, with its sublimely simple <span class="text">“O. O…”</span> (compared, say, to Watling’s Penguin <span class="text">translation: “Oh God…”</span> in line 1182). Indeed, <span class="performance">Olivier’s scream</span>, in <span class="text">Yeats’ text</span>, anticipated in important ways the <span class="performance">Beckettian scream</span> of the next few decades."

<span class="character">HERDSMAN</span>. Do not ask any more, master; for the love of God<br> do not ask. <span class="reference">785</span><br>
<span class="character">OEDIPUS</span>. You are lost if I have to question you again.<br>
<span class="character">HERDSMAN</span>. It was a child from the house of Laius.<br>
<span class="character">OEDIPUS</span>. A slave? Or one of his own race?<br>
<span class="character">HERDSMAN</span>. Alas! I am on the edge of dreadful words.<br>
<span class="character">OEDIPUS</span>. And I of hearing: yet hear I must. <span class="reference">790</span><br>
<span class="character">HERDSMAN</span>. It was said to have been his own child. But your lady<br> within can tell you of these things best.<br>
<span class="character">OEDIPUS</span>. How? It was she who gave it to you?<br>
<span class="character">HERDSMAN</span>. Yes, King.<br>
<span class="character">OEDIPUS</span>. To what end? <span class="reference">795</span><br>
<span class="character">HERDSMAN</span>. That I should make away with it.<br>
<span class="character">OEDIPUS</span>. Her own child?<br>
<span class="character">HERDSMAN</span>. Yes: from fear of evil prophecies.<br>
<span class="character">OEDIPUS</span>. What prophecies?<br>
<span class="character">HERDSMAN</span>. That he should kill his father.<span class="reference">800</span><br>
<span class="character">OEDIPUS</span>. Why, then, did you give him up to this old man?<br>
<span class="character">HERDSMAN</span>. Through pity, master, believing that he would carry him<br> to whatever land he had himself come from – but he saved him for <br>dreadful misery; for if you are what this man says, you are the <br>most miserable of all men.<span class="reference">805</span><br>
<span class="character">OEDIPUS</span>. <span class="performance"><span class="text">O! O!</span></span> All brought to pass! All truth! Now, O light, may <br>I look my last upon you, having been found accursed in blood-<br>shed, accursed in marriage, and in my coming into the world<br> accursed!
