<h1>A Few Hieroglyphs</h1>
<p>The most common Hieroglyph is the seated man: <span class="hiero">𓀀</span>. It is given the code A1 in <a href="https://mjn.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/egyptian/unicode/tablemain.html">Gardiner's Sign List</a>. It is used as a determinative at the end of many words in order to indicate that the word belongs to the semantic category of male humans. 

<p> There is also a seated woman: <span class="hiero">𓁐</span>. It has the code B1. It is used in much the same way as the seated man. </p>

<p>In the first column on the right near the top, there are examples of the seated man and seated woman hieroglyphs. When reading the signs, you read towards the faces of human figures and animals. In this case, the man is read first and then the woman. Here the two signs followed by the three strokes to indicate a plural are read together as the word for "people."</p>
