<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatra"> <i>Hatra</i></a> yielded a very large number of sculptures, more than all the other Parthian cities, dating from the late second century to the early third century A.D (see Dirven, 2008). These sculptures are material evidence of religious and social life within the city. More than ten types of images of kings, generals, priests, princes and others, and more than 30 varieties of images of gods, including those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamash"> <b>Shamash</b><a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rekrei-production/images/images/000/000/426/square/Picture_054.jpg?1426799159"> <b>Barmaren</b><a>, <b>Atargatis</b>, <b>Baalshamin</b>, <b>Allat</b> and <b>Heracles</b> have been identified in the city. Almost all of the statues were found inside the small temples and the great sanctuary, sometimes in the cult niches of the cella, or on brackets approximately two meters high from the ground. Life-size statues of deities are rare and the larger figures are mostly of kings, royalties and notables. They probably have a religious function since they are set up in the presence of the gods and make a gesture of praying. They are carved to be seen from the front and are usually standing and measure about 1.90 meters high.<p>Schlumberger compares Hatrene statues to those of the ancient East and archaic Greek world and concludes that they present iconographic peculiarities that are specific to the ancient Orient. The raised right hand with the palm facing outward, in worship, and the palm branch in the left hand derive from Eastern tradition and oppose the common style in the Classical and Hellenistic world (Schlumberger, 1970: 141). The statues, especially their costumes, are very detailed which is indeed the characteristic of late Parthian sculpture dated between 150 and 225 AD (Mathiesen, 1992: 34).<p>It can be observed that the costumes, the gestures and in general the iconography of the statues are useful in identifying the social function of the characters represented. For instance, <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dulnRuXSWWE/VQVRINXy_0I/AAAAAAAAGO0/Zv3DBWwMqlo/s1600/Hatra_sonsSanatruq.gif"> the young princes<a> usually have clean-shaven faces, but kings have a moustache and a beard; most of them have chubby bellies and, according to Downey, this iconography is perhaps a sign of wealth in a region where food was not abundant (Downey, 1982: 582). The bigger than life-size statue of <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-txSgOJr0abA/VQB7tc8AC3I/AAAAAAAAGLs/AfmNgJUEzdE/s1600/Hatra_Uthal.gif"> <b>King Uthal</b><a> is known as the finest of all the sculptures unearthed in Hatra and was discovered in a small shrine, Temple III. The king stands erect with his left leg placed forward, his left hand resting on the handle of his long sword and his right hand raised palm-outward. On his head rests a tall tiara and he is wearing Parthian style trousers. The lower end of the tiara is tied to the Kingâ€™s head by leathery strings. On his upper body, reaching as far down as his knees, is a long tunic, on top of which the king wears an over-coat set off with furry material.
