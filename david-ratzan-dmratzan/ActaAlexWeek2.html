<p><h2>Section from <i>Power, Form and Genre in the</i> Acta Alexandrinorum</h2></p>

<p>In the <i>Acta Isidori</i> we have a trial scene, set at the imperial court in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"><span class="place">Rome</span></a>, in which <span class="person">Isidorus</span> and <span class="person">Lampon</span>, aggressively proud Alexandrian elites, argue with the emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius"><span class="emperor">Claudius</span></a>. From what we can gather, <span class="person">Isidorus</span> seems to have been a prosecutor or informer, a <i>delator</i> of sorts, in the court of <span class="emperor">Claudius’s</span> predecessor, <span class="emperor">Caligula</span>. Now <span class="person">Isidorus</span> is accusing <span class="person">King Agrippa</span> of something, despite <span class="emperor">Claudius’s </span> warnings to be careful because he has brought down friends of his in the past. One of these friends is a very interesting person. "Naevius" is surely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naevius_Sutorius_Macro"><span class="person">Naevius Sertorius Macro</span></a>, the Praetorian Prefect who, according to <span class="person">Tacitus</span>, engineered the downfall of <span class="emperor">Tiberius’s</span> powerful Praetorian Prefect <span class="person">Sejanus</span> and <span class="emperor">Caligula’s</span> succession. </p>

<p><span class="person">Isidorus</span>, <span class="person">Lampon</span>, and <span class="person">Balbillus</span> are also known figures. <span class="person">Philo</span>, an elite, Hellenized Jew from <span class="place">Alexandria</span>, casts the first two as some of the chief villains in the Greek-Jewish tensions roiling <span class="place">Alexandria</span> in the <span class="date">30’s</span>, which exploded in a spasm of violence in <span class="date">38</span>, when the Jews were ultimately forced into the <span class="place">Delta quadrant</span> of the city and pillaged. Two sets of ambassadors went to <span class="place">Rome</span> in the aftermath of the riots, one Greek and one Jewish, with <span class="person">Philo</span> being a member of the Jewish delegation and whose political pamphlets we still have. According to <span class="person">Philo</span>, <span class="person">Isidorus</span> was in exile in <span class="place">Rome</span> and was involved with the prosecution of <span class="person">Aulus Avilius Flaccus</span>, the Prefect of Egypt, whose actions in <span class="date">38</span> added fuel to the fire. Here, then, we seem to have further evidence of <span class="person">Isidorus’s</span> activity in <span class="place">Rome</span>.</p>

<p>Finally, <span class="person">King Agrippa</span> is either <span class="person">M. Julius Agrippa</span>, <span class="person">Herod the Great’s</span> grandson, also known as <span class="person">Herod Agrippa</span> <span class="date">(11 BCE – 44CE)</span>, whose visit to <span class="place">Alexandria</span> in <span class="date">38</span> was the spark that ignited city. If so, the dramatic date of our text is likely <span class="date">41</span>. If not, it is his son by the same name and the last of the Herodians <span class="date">(27/28 – 93/94)</span>, and the year is <span class="date">52</span> or <span class="date">53</span>. Sadly, although the text begins with the date, the year is lost in a lacuna, and there are arguments for and against both dates.</p>

<p>Besides the historical grounding, two other features of this trial scene stand out. The first is the prominence of <span class="person">Isidorus’s</span> anti-Semitism. The Greek-Jewish violence of <span class="date">38</span> and the dueling embassies that subsequently travelled to <span class="place">Rome</span> gave birth a complex literary response, and we should imagine that this text originally circulated and competed with <span class="person">Philo’s</span> pamphlets, dueling forms of ex post facto political spin literature in the ensuing cold war between the Greek and Jewish factions. Anti-Semitism is a constant feature of the first century of <i>Acta</i> texts, as they update the conflict between Alexandrians, Jews, and Roman authorities in each successive generation from <span class="emperor">Caligula</span> to <span class="emperor">Hadrian</span>. We should recall that between <span class="date">38</span> and <span class="date">130</span> the Jews had revolted three times against the imperial order, with the Jews in <span class="place">Alexandria</span> and <span class="place">Egypt</span> deeply involved in the revolts of <span class="date">66-70</span> and <span class="date">115-117</span>. The last revolt engulfed much of <span class="place">Egypt</span> and resulted in the decimation of the Jewish population and generations of hatred and prejudice. We know from one petition to <span class="emperor">Severus</span> and <span class="emperor">Caracalla</span> that <span class="place">Oxyrhynchos</span> celebrated the victory in the “war” against the Jews a century later (<a href="http://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.oxy;4;705"><i>P.Oxy.</i> III 705</a> = CPJ 450), when most of <i>Acta</i> texts were copied. So, while it is important to note that the <i>Acta</i> texts are not merely vehicles for anti-Semitic sentiment, such feelings helped to maintain a market for this literature in <span class="place">Egypt</span> even as late as the third century.</p>

<p>Second, although the Acts of Isidore appear to have a historical basis, they also seem to be a species of fiction. Isidorus is aggressively, suicidally proud, repeatedly insulting Claudius in front of his consistory. Are we to imagine that Claudius or any Roman emperor would have suffered being spoken to like this? Hardly. Do we believe that this conversation would have been recorded? Supposing it was, would it have been made accessible? At best, it is based on some sort of minutes. However we imagine the relationship between the original source documents and our texts, it is clear that Alexandrian patriotism and heroism in the fact of Roman tyranny is the unifying literary theme driving the production, if not always the reading, of these texts. Also interesting is the fact that in the act of composition, the some of features of a documentary protocol should have either been retained or superadded.</p>

<p>But, what are we reading? 

<h3>Form</h3>

<p>The protocol form of the texts, combined with the basic historicity of the characters and even occasional Latinisms, led the first scholars who read these texts to see the Acta as essentially documentary. But as more and more of these texts appeared, it became clear to everyone working on them that they were dealing with some sort of literary phenomenon. Theories abounded. They were part of a lost history of Alexandria; they were the generic cousins or perhaps even the direct ancestors of the Christian martyr acts; they were historical romance; they were all fragments of the work of single author in the early third century; they were politically-motivated embellishments of real documentary sources. That is to say these texts had gone from belonging to the wide documentary genre, protocol, to a limbo of almost total generic uncertainty: Were they one text or many texts? Were they examples of a wider genre of martyr texts or history or romance, or were they themselves their own genre? What was their origin, their genetic relationship to other texts, their literary analogs? </p>

<p>The period of generic debate was most intense in the first quarter of the 20th century, but the defining moment in the modern interpretation of these texts was the defining scientific, critical edition of the Acta in 1954 by the Oxford-educated, Jesuit classics professor, Herbert Musurillo. In his preface, Musurillo states that his interest in the Acta began with his reading of an article by C.B. Welles in TAPA in 1936 – at age 18! – on a new fragment of what Welles called “The Acts of the Heathen Martyrs of Alexandria,” “a humble offshoot of a class of literature popular in the first centuries of the Christian Era.” Welles in his first footnote traced his understanding of this class of popular literature to one of the earliest attempts to class these texts as literature, an article in 1901 by Adolf Bauer in the first volume of Archiv für Papyrusforschung, edited by Ulrich Wilcken, himself not only a major ancient historian and one of the first papyrologists (a term coined only at the turn of the century), but also a major participant in the debate over the basic historicity and generic nature of the Acta. Bauer’s article was, in fact, the first to apply a new and definite literary genre to the texts, identifying them as heidnische Märtyrenakten, assimilating them to Christian martyr acts. His was the label that stuck, accounting for Musurillo’s choice of title for his edition, even though he himself went to some pains to distance them from the Christian martyr acts, reflected in his preference for the term he uses in his subtitle, the Acta Alexandrinorum.</p>

<p>It is hard to overstate the impact of Musurillo’s work on the subsequent interpretation of these texts. By systematically collecting, collating, annotating, and presenting them in a fashion reserved for literary texts, he simultaneously cemented a particular generic orientation and created a canon. This effect was, if anything, amplified by his publication of a second critical edition with Teubner in 1961. Although new pieces were published just as Musurillo submitted his Teubner manuscript, these and all new pieces edited and identified as Acta between 1954 and the first decade of the present century have taken Musurillo’s work as the generic point of departure. To be sure, it was not only Musurillo’s masterly encapsulation of the scholarly debate that preceded him, but also the passing of the first generation of scholarly protagonists and a shifting academic agenda that together account the fifty-year drought that followed. Yet, with the generic questions seemingly settled, the scholarly interest in these texts contracted entirely, and perhaps somewhat ironically, to the realm of ancient history, and in particular the history of Alexandria, the administration of early Roman Egypt, and Jews in the Roman world. For a new synthetic appraisal or theoretical analysis of the Acta one had to wait until the publication of Andrew Harker’s dissertation in 2008.</p>
